VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of App::DzilUtils (from Perl

SYNOPSIS
    This distribution provides the following command-line utilities:

     list-dzil-bundle-contents

     list-dzil-plugins

    Bash tab completion is available. To activate, put this in your shell
    script startup:

     complete -C list-dzil-bundles         list-dzil-bundles
     complete -C list-dzil-plugin-roles    list-dzil-plugin-roles
     complete -C list-dzil-plugins         list-dzil-plugins

    Check back often, there will be more utilities added.

FAQ
  In shell completion, why do you use / (slash) instead of :: (double colon) as it should be?
    If you type module name which doesn't contain any ::, / will be used as
    namespace separator. Otherwise if you already type ::, it will use ::.

    Colon is problematic because by default it is a word breaking character
    in bash. This means, in this command:

     % list-dzil-bundle-contents Author:<tab>

    bash is completing a new word (empty string), and in this:

     % list-dzil-bundle-contents Author::SHARYAN<tab>

    bash is completing "SHARYAN" instead of what we want "Author::SHARYAN".

    The solution is to use quotes, e.g.

     % list-dzil-bundle-contents "Author::SHARYAN<tab>
     % list-dzil-bundle-contents 'Author::SHARYAN<tab>

    or, use /:

     % list-dzil-bundle-contents author/sharyan<tab>

    Note that most completion are made case-insensitive for convenience.
